# Haberman's Survival Neural Network

## Overview

This project implements a predictive model for Haberman's Survival Dataset using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Haberman's dataset contains patient data related to breast cancer surgery, and our goal is to predict the survival status of patients based on various features.

Artificial neural networks, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), are employed to analyze and learn from the dataset, ultimately making predictions regarding patient survival.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Haberman's Survival Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Haberman%27s+Survival) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains information on patients who underwent breast cancer surgery, including their age, year of operation, number of positive lymph nodes detected, and survival status.

## Usage

To run this project and perform survival predictions, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imrichkascak/habernal-survival-neural-network.git

2. Install the required Python libraries. You can use pip to install dependencies:

   ```bash
   brew install jupyter

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook provided in the project folder:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   
4. Navigate to the Jupyter Notebook file `src/er1602.ipynb` and execute the cells to train the neural network on the provided dataset and make predictions on new data.
